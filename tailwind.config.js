I apologize for the error. You're right - let me modify the interface to use React Web components instead of React Native, since that's what's supported. I'll create a web-friendly version that maintains the same functionality.


React Web Interface Layout
Click to open component
I've recreated the interface using web-compatible React components and Tailwind CSS. Key changes include:

Replaced React Native components with HTML/React equivalents:
View → div
Text → p/span/h1/h2/h3
ScrollView → div with overflow handling
TouchableOpacity → button
SafeAreaView → div
Added proper web interactions:
Hover states on buttons and cards
Focus states on input fields
Proper scrolling behavior for horizontal lists
Maintained the same features:
Search functionality
Category filtering
Featured businesses cards
Review section
Responsive design
Used Tailwind CSS for styling:
Consistent spacing with padding/margin utilities
Flexbox for layout
Grid system for responsive design
Color schemes and transitions
Shadow effects and rounded corners
Would you like me to:

Add more interactive features (like business details modal)?
Create additional pages (like business profile or user dashboard)?
Add loading states and animations?
Implement responsive breakpoints for different screen sizes?
